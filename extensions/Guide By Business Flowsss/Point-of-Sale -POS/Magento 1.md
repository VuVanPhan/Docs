## How to use  ##
The general workflow of POS System includes 3 parts: 

 - General Sale Process
 - POS Order
 - POS Return Order

And here are the detailed instruction for each section which could help users adapt to this system quickly and effectively. 

### General Sales Process ##
We will explain this workflow according to the timing circle: Opening the store, running and finally, closing.  

-	When first ship of the day started, POS Manager will open session in order to create the Opening Balance - the amount of cash in your store at that time. 

	Those numbers will be saved in the system, so POS could provide you information about daily revenue after a working day. 

	Particularly, when you log in to any POS, a window of opening session will pop-up automatically. 

- Next step, after the Opening Balance was saved by POS Manager, Cashiers now are able to create orders and they start running cash flow in your store. 

	They receive the payment from customers and then put the change back to them. Those actions happen in turn, again and again, so your store will have cash in as well as cash out. 


**NOTE: **This function is available now in Magento 2 and will be updated soon for  Magento 1. 



### POS Order  ##
Like the flow we explain above, this section is also instructed according to the timing circle. Particularly, it is the customer buying process. 

 - Initially, Customers select products to buy and bring them to Cashier
   to pay.

 

 - Then, Cashier could add them to carts.
 
 	![Cashier add products to carts](./Anh%20M1/anh%201%20M1%20.png?raw=true)  
 	
	![Cashier add products to carts](./Anh%20M1/anh%202%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 
	
 Anyway, one thing to remind retailers is that having a customer card system is extremely necessary for sales strategy. So, it exists a demand from POS System: make sure all of the shoppers, even when they are not regular consumers, have member cards at your store. 
 
- If this buyer were a brand new customer, Cashier would create a new one.  Here is the detailed instruction:
   
![Cashier creates a new customer](./Anh%20M1/anh%203%20m1%20.png?raw=true)  
	
![Cashier creates a new customer](./Anh%20M1/anh%204%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 

Tap the human icon > “Create Customer”
  
- Otherwise, Cashier could search and create order based on customer history data. All the staffs need to do is typing the customer information (such as: phone number, email, address,..)

 - After adding products to carts, Cashiers would push sales by applying Promotion and Loyalty Program – which are available functions when retailers install specialized extensions for their own POS System. For instance, they are Coupon Code, Gift Card, Reward Point and Store Credit.
   
    ![Promotion and Loyalty Program](./Anh%20M1/anh%205%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 
    ![Promotion and Loyalty Program](./Anh%20M1/anh%206%20m1%20.png?raw=true)  
    ![Promotion and Loyalty Program](./Anh%20M1/anh%207%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 

 - Next step, Cashier must select shipping method:
	 -	Customers would receive goods at store if they buy in-store. 
	 -	The other option is shipping to customer’s address. 

 - Then, Cashiers have to choose shipping and payment method
	 - In this step, if customers require invoice, Cashiers will take the output of Customer Invoice. 
	 
	 ![shipping and payment method](./Anh%20M1/anh%208%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 
	![shipping and payment method](./Anh%20M1/anh%209%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 
	

	

 - After that, Cashier need to validate this POS order to make sure this
   transaction is available.
	 - If this transaction is confirmed as a good delivery, then it will be accomplished in the next few seconds. 
	 - 	Otherwise, Cashier may cancel this order, back to the previous step to serve another customer.
 - Finally, as customers open their wallets to pay for orders, cash flow
   will be created (Cashier will receive money and put the change back).
   It appears the cash-in and out.
   Obviously, all of these cash flows are recorded in the system. 
	- If Cashiers put money in Cash Drawer, Cash-in will be saved with reason.
	- If Cashiers take money out Cash Drawer, Cash-out will be also saved with reason. 

 

It is the end of “POS Order” workflow. 

### POS Return Order ##
In case Consumers want to return products, here is the process your staffs need following to deal with the change in data system. 

From the history data of POS Order, Cashiers are able to **check the return rule.** 
If this Return Order is valid, all those steps below need accomplishing: 

 - Cashier will create Return Order 
 - Then, Good Receipt is allowed and the system is available to receive product
 - After that, Customer will be refunded
 
 Here is step-by-step instruction: 

* **Step 1**: Check Refund Policy
 
	- From the history data of POS Order, Cashiers/Sales Staffs are able to check the return rule. If the order meets the refund condition, then POS staffs go to the next process of refunding. 
 
	- NOTE: Some certain staffs have permission to issue refund by cash/credits (which is set by admin in the backend). 


* **Step 2**: Implement Refund Process 
 
	- To issue refund, go to Orders tab in POS screen, choose Orders History, select the order that is required to refund.  Tap on Refund button at the end of the popup.

	![Implement Refund Process ](./Anh%20M1/anh%2010%20m1%20.png?raw=true) 


	- A popup will display so that you can fill in the information before making refund.  Tick “Return to stock” if you want to return those items back to your stock.

	![Implement Refund Process ](./Anh%20M1/anh%2011%20m1%20.png?raw=true)

	[1]  Name of the refund product
	
	[2]  Adjust Refund:
	
	[3] Adjust Fee:
	
	[4] Refund by Credits.

	- Instead of refund by cash, you can refund for customer a certain amount of credits to keep them around your store and purchase next time. 
 
	- Hit “**Submit Refund**”. After that, you will get the message informing that credit memo is created successfully.  Please make sure you have permission to issue refund.
 
* **Step 3**: Exchange the product in the order
 
	- If the customer want to exchange the product, create a refund like the same steps above at Make Order(s).  Then create the same order, with the exchange product. After that,  proceed with the order and check out.  

	- End the exchange product.
