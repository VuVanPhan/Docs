Your customers can't make up their minds yet, or are unable to make a payment meanwhile? They may want to purchase items that are for pre-order or currently out of stocks? You don't want to lose those potential customers, don't you? Then, Web POS's new feature can put these orders on hold - no limit in time - until they are ready to continue processing!

After adding products to cart, you can choose **Hold** to put the order into **On-hold Orders** section. A **Note for holding order** will appear for inserting any comment that you would like to keep, for example, “Waiting for payment”.

### How to manage cash drawer


#### Manage cash flow into cash drawer

To manage cash drawer, you go to tab Cash Drawer on Web POS checkout screen.

As you see on the below image, there is a list of orders paid in cash on the left screen (cash transactions). The total value of cash transactions equals to the balance in cash drawers. The amounts paid with other payment methods are displayed on Sales by Payments section.

![Cash Drawer tab](./Image_Web%20POS/image169.jpg)

You have frequent cash in/out beside normal order transactions like paying electrical bills, balancing cash amount in hand, etc? Web POS system records deposits and withdrawals from your cash drawer then compare them with actual cash amount (counted in notes) after each cashier’s shift.

![Cash in/Cash out buttons](./Image_Web%20POS/image171.jpg)

When your cashier’s shift ends, you count the cash amount on cash drawers and compared with the one recorded by the system. You can also record the amount of cash left for the next shift and add some notes.

![Enter Cash counted/ Cash left fields](./Image_Web%20POS/image173.jpg)


#### Z-report

Z-report shows the cash drawer balance in a certain time like a shift or a working day. All payment methods will be listed down with the record of Grand Total in details respectively. If there is no customer use Cash on Delivery method to purchase orders, it will not appear in the Payment Method section.

![Z-report](./Image_Web%20POS/image175.jpg)

The Z-report will be refreshed to serve new shift/working day after you select Close Store. Particularly, your cash drawer will be reset to 0 or to the certain amount that you set up in Cash Left. Each Z-report is automatically saved in Magento backend so you can check it back (go to Sales > Web POS > Web POS Z-report)
