<a name="p12"> </a>

- The price of Gift Card product may differ from Gift Card value. It depends on Admin’s configuration in backend, which could be a fixed value or a percentage of Gift Card value. If the price type is “percentage”, Customers will see the corresponding Gift Card prices when they choose different Gift Card values.

It is possible for Customers to personalize their Gift Card by uploading their own image as well. The recommended size for image to upload is 250x365px. 3 file types are supported including .GIF, .JPG and .PNG.

  If Customers upload an image with an unsupported file type or the image is larger than the maximum file size configured by Admin, the system will auto-show an alert message to notify Customers. 
  
   
Customers can also see the expiration date of the Gift Card on Gift Card image.

### Create/Edit a Gift Card Products


There are two ways to create a Gift Card product: on **Manage Gift Card Products** page and on **Manage Products** page.

- Create Gift Card on **Manage Gift Card Products** page:

Go to Gift Card menu→ **Manage Gift Card Products**

![Go to Gift Card menu](./Image_GiftcardM1/image084.png)

Click on **Add Gift Card Product** button

![Add Gift Card Product](./Image_GiftcardM1/image086.png)

Click on Continue button then enter information as a normal product. You should pay attention to the following tabs:

- **General** tab:

Different from normal products, there is another required field, **Select Gift Card template**, allowing you to choose templates for Gift Card product. You can add more templates to this field in **Manage Gift Card Templates** 
<a name="p13"> </a>

![Add more templates](./Image_GiftcardM1/image088.png)

- **Prices** tab:

  
In **Prices** tab, Admin can configure prices and values of a Gift Card Product.
![Configure prices and values of a Gift Card Product](./Image_GiftcardM1/image090.png)

The module provides 3 **types of Gift Card value**, including **fixed value, range of values and dropdown values**. You can base on the type chosen to set Gift Card value(s) accordingly such as 50-100 (USD) for the **range of values** type.

The next step you need to do is selecting the type of Gift Card price, which could be 1 in 3 following options:

   - **Default**: Gift Card price is the same as Gift Card value by default.
   - **Fixed number**: Gift Card price is a fixed number as you configure in the next field.
   - **Percent of Gift Card value**: Gift Card price is a percentage of Gift Card value as you configure in the next field.
     
If you choose the type of Gift Card price as **Fixed number** or **Percent of Gift Card value**, remember to fill in the next field **Price/ Percentage** to set the price for your Gift Card product.

The following example will help you have better understanding about these configurations.

   - **Type of Gift Card value**: Dropdown values
    - **Gift Card values**: 20,30,40
    - **Type of Gift Card price**: Percent of Gift Card value
    - **Percentage**: 90,90,90
     
So Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.
<a name="p11"> </a>

- **Conditions** tabs:

The difference between a Gift Card product and a normal product is that a Gift Card product contains 2 more condition tabs, which are **Shopping Cart Conditions** and **Cart Item Conditions**.

  - The **Shopping Cart Conditions** tab enables you to set up the conditions applied to shopping cart when Customers use Gift Card, for example: Customers can only use their Gift Card for orders which have Subtotal equals or is greater than $200.
 
![Set up the conditions applied to shopping cart](./Image_GiftcardM1/image092.png)

  - The **Cart Item Conditions** tab allows you to set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers’ shopping cart. For example, Customers can use their Gift Cards to pay for orders only if the Qty. in cart is equal or greater than 2.
 <a name="p4"> </a>
 
![set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers’ shopping cart](./Image_GiftcardM1/image094.png)

**_Note_**: Normally some common product attributes are enabled to use with promotion rules by default. If you don’t see the attribute you want when setting **Gift Card’s Conditions**, such as SKU, you can go to Catalog→ Attributes→ Manage Attributes. Search and choose Attribute Code, such as &quot;SKU&quot;. Then change &quot;Use for Promo Rule Conditions&quot; to &quot;Yes&quot;




Remember to click on **Save** or **Save and Continue Edit** button to save your work. After saving, the Gift Card product which you have just created will be shown on **Manage Gift Products** page as below:

- Create Gift Card on **Manage Products** page:
  - Go to Catalog menu → **Manage Products**   
  - Click on **Add Product** button
  - Select **Product Type: Gift Card**
  
![Product Type: Gift Card](./Image_GiftcardM1/image098.png)

  - Click on **Continue** button and enter information as in **Manage Gift Card Product** page.
![enter information in Manage Gift Card Product page ](./Image_GiftcardM1/image100.png)

![Manage Gift Products page](./Image_GiftcardM1/image102.png)

![Manage Gift Products page](./Image_GiftcardM1/image104.png)

In order to edit any Gift product, you need to click on corresponding row or link **Edit**. Remember to click on **Save** or **Save and Continue Edit** button after editing to save your work.
