## How to use


### How to earn points

When placing an order, Customers can earn points based on the rate set by admin.
Our Standard edition makes sure that Customers are well aware of your reward point policy by showing messages on many pages. For example, on Product Detail pages, there will be a notification for Customers that says “You could receive some Points for purchasing this product”.

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image002.png?raw=true)

Also, after clicking on the **Add to Cart** button, on **Mini Cart**, Customers will see another notification “**Check out now to earn points**”.

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image003.png?raw=true)

If Customers have not logged in yet, a notification message “**Login and checkout to earn points**” will be shown on mini cart:

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image004.png?raw=true)

On **Checkout** page, Customers can see exactly the number of points they earned from buying that product in the **Grand Total** box:

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image005.png?raw=true)

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image006.png?raw=true)

After placing an order successfully, Customers can check their point balance right next to the **My Account** top link or can go directly to that link:

###	How to spend points

On **Shopping Cart** and **Checkout** pages, Customers can move the slide forwards or backwards to select the number of points they would like to spend. They can also just click on the **Minus** or **Plus** icons. Besides, they can enter this number in the empty box or tick the checkbox “**Maximize my discount with points**” to spend the maximum number of points. 

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image008.png?raw=true)

On the **Checkout** page, System shows a similar form for Customers to edit the number of points they want to spend for their orders:

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image009.png?raw=true)

Customers can follow and manage their current points in 2 places:
On the one hand, they can view their current points on the top link as below:

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image010.png?raw=true)

On the other hand, they can go to **My Account > My Rewards** to view more information.

![enter image description here](./image_Reward%20Point%20Plus%20Standard%20Edition/image011.png?raw=true)

As you can see, this page can be divided into two parts: **Reward Information** and **Recent Transactions**

 - **Reward Information**: In this part, Customers can view their current balances as well as description about earning/ spending point rates on your site.
 - **Recent Transactions**: This part provides Customers with information on their transactions of reward points including ID, points, action, date and status. 
If Customers want to see all transactions, they can click on the **View all** links or the **Point Transactions** tab.
